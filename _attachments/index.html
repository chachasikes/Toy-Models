      <p>Toy models are simple but powerful tools that allow you to explore urban 
planning and understand cumulative effects at a regional level.

Our first toy model is a neighborhood health planner. We have a small model
of a residential neighborhood, and a catalog of civic improvement strategies & tactics
which you can apply to the neighborhood.

It is possible to replace the data in the toy model with real data from your
own neighborhood. The model works for small neighborhoods. You could also take a
similar approach to quantify regional systems.

The ultimate goal is to provide a real-time neighborhood health indicator,
for any neighborhood, and present civic activities which are working
to improve quality of life. We often do civic work based on some data
of improvement, but demonstrating this visually has been impossible until now.
